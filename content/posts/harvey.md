Two of my favorite podcasts are [Radiolab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab) and [The Anthropocene Reviewed](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/anthropocene-reviewed) (AR), today I'll be writing about an episode I heard from the latter.

I learned about [John Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Green_(author)) (producer of AR) from his book [Turtles All the Way Down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_All_the_Way_Down_(novel)). I was curious since I heard of the title before in Stephen Hawking's book, [A Brief History of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brief_History_of_Time). Here is the excerpt I remembered:

> A well-known scientist (some say it was Bertrand Russell) once gave a public lecture on astronomy. He described how the earth orbits around the sun and how the sun, in turn, orbits around the centre of a vast collection of stars called our galaxy. At the end of the lecture, a little old lady at the back of the room got up and said: "What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant tortoise." The scientist gave a superior smile before replying, "What is the tortoise standing on?" "You're very clever, young man, very clever," said the old lady. "But it's turtles all the way down!" - Stephen Hawking

John Green reviewed the movie Harvey in [this episode](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/anthropocene-reviewed/episodes/anthropocene-reviewed-velociraptors-and-harvey), he also reviewed velociraptors, which was also good, but let's focus on the latter.

I'll summarize to make the point and also to accommodate for non-podcast listening folks. John Green described a hard time he was going through and his boss then, recommended Harvey to watch while taking a couple of weeks off work. Trust me, you should listen to the episode.

I was compelled to watch the movie, so one night, I decided it was Harvey night. I got so intrested in Harvey (the [PÃºca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%BAca)), but the main charchter was elwood p. dowd.
